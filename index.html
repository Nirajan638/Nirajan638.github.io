    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="content">
     
      <p>Hello! My name is Nirajan Khatri, and I am currently studying at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in the Information Technology (ITBBA) degree program. I completed my higher secondary education back in my home country, Nepal, in 2021. My journey into the field of information technology began during my school years, where I developed a growing curiosity about how computers and digital systems work.</p>

<p>Over time, this curiosity turned into a strong interest in exploring different aspects of IT, from web development and networking to understanding how technology impacts daily life. I have developed a solid foundation in basic IT skills such as computer hardware, software applications, and networking fundamentals. I also enjoy working on creative digital projects that allow me to combine technical knowledge with problem-solving and design thinking.</p>

<p>As a student, I am eager to learn new technologies, improve my programming skills, and apply my knowledge to real-world challenges. My long-term goal is to become a skilled IT professional who can contribute innovative solutions and make a positive impact in the technology field. This portfolio represents my personal and academic journey  a space where I share my learning experiences, projects, and reflections as I continue to grow in the world of information technology.</p>

        <h3>Restaurant Menu Design</h3>
        <p>I created a restaurant menu as one of my key projects to develop my design and presentation skills. The purpose of this project was to design an attractive and easy-to-read menu that clearly displays different food categories, descriptions, and prices. I focused on layout balance, font selection, and visual organization to make the menu look professional and user-friendly.</p>
         <p> While working on this project, I also learned how important visual hierarchy and spacing are in design. This experience helped me improve my attention to detail and understand how creative design can enhance customer experience in a real-world business setting.</p>

        <h3>Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
        <p>Another project I have worked on is this personal portfolio website, which I designed and built to showcase my academic background, skills, and projects as a student of Information Technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences.</p>
        <p> The website serves as my digital identity a place where teachers, classmates, and potential employers can learn more about me and my work. Through this project, I practiced HTML structure, layout design, and organizing web content in a clear and professional way. Building this portfolio has also strengthened my confidence in web development and encouraged me to keep improving my technical and creative skills.</p>
